_This project was created in 24 hours for [BostonHacks 2024](https://www.bostonhacks.org/) held at Boston University from November 2-3, 2024. [See the submission on Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/openbnb-epignk)_

Natural disasters like the recent hurricane Milton displace millions of people around the world every year, leaving them in urgent need of shelter and support. Traditional evacuation shelters can often be overcrowded and stressful, adding to the psychological strain on evacuees.

OpenBnB is a web platform that connects evacuees displaced by natural disasters with hosts offering temporary housing. By enabling individuals to list their homes as safe havens or find shelter in times of crisis, OpenBnB fosters a community-driven approach to compassionate and accessible housing when it's needed most. Unlike traditional shelters, OpenBnB provides a calmer, more personal environment for those in need.
